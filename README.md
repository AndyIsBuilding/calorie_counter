# Calorie and Protein Tracker 
Used to track my calories and protein every day. I'm not a fan of big, bulky apps
with features I don't need. These apps aren't known as beacons of privacy either.

This simple app allows me to track calories and protein easily, offering quick-
action buttons for the most common foods and manual entry for when I'm trying 
that new dish at a restaurant.
